# Pentagon Gymnastics - Fixes Applied

## ðŸŽ¨ Diagram Generation Issues - FIXED

### Problem
- Diagrams were overlapping with content on top of each other
- Python script was hanging and not completing
- Only one image was being generated

### Solution Applied
- **Enhanced Spacing**: Increased spacing between diagram components to prevent overlap
- **Strategic Positioning**: Used calculated positions with proper margins
- **Removed setTimeout Issues**: Eliminated hanging by fixing the diagram generation loop
- **Professional Layout**: Applied grid-based positioning for better visual hierarchy
- **Clear Categorization**: Used color coding for different component types

### Results
âœ… All 4 diagrams now generate successfully:
- Class Diagram (UML)
- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) 
- Sequence Diagram
- Component Architecture Diagram

âœ… Each diagram saved in both PNG (high-res) and PDF (vector) formats
âœ… Professional layout suitable for dissertation inclusion

## ðŸ’³ Payment System Issues - FIXED

### Problem 1: Test Cards Not Working
- Test cards were not properly initialized
- Payment processing was hanging due to setTimeout issues
- Users couldn't complete payments

### Solution Applied
- **Added Test Card Seeding**: Updated `prisma/seed.ts` to create test cards
- **Removed setTimeout**: Fixed payment controller to respond immediately
- **Enhanced Card Validation**: Improved card validation logic
- **Better Error Messages**: Added specific error codes and messages

### Test Cards Available
```
4111111111111111 - Valid Visa (Â£10,000 balance)
5555555555554444 - Valid Mastercard (Â£5,000 balance)
4000000000000002 - Declined Visa (for testing failures)
4000000000000119 - Insufficient Funds Visa (Â£10 balance)
378282246310005 - Valid Amex (Â£15,000 balance)
```

### Problem 2: Payment Hanging
- `setTimeout` was causing responses to hang
- Frontend was waiting indefinitely

### Solution Applied
- **Immediate Response**: Removed all `setTimeout` delays from payment processing
- **Proper Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling
- **Transaction Safety**: Maintained database transaction integrity

## ðŸ”„ Subscription Sync Issues - FIXED

### Problem
- Packages page showed subscription but classes tab didn't recognize it
- Error 500 when selecting classes after subscription
- Inconsistent subscription state between frontend and backend

### Solution Applied

#### Backend Fixes
1. **Fixed Route Mismatch**: 
   - Frontend was calling `/subscriptions/subscription`
   - Backend route was `/subscriptions/create`
   - âœ… Updated frontend to use correct endpoint

2. **Enhanced Subscription Creation**:
   - Better validation for existing subscriptions
   - Proper cleanup of pending subscriptions
   - Include package and class details in response

3. **Improved Session Booking**:
   - Better subscription validation
   - Clear error messages with error codes
   - Enhanced access control validation

#### Frontend Fixes
1. **Corrected API Endpoint**: Fixed subscription creation endpoint
2. **Better Error Handling**: Added specific error codes for different scenarios
3. **Enhanced State Management**: Improved query invalidation after subscription changes

### Enhanced Error Handling
Now provides specific error codes:
- `NO_SUBSCRIPTION`: User has no subscription
- `SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_ACTIVE`: Subscription exists but not active
- `SUBSCRIPTION_EXPIRED`: Subscription has expired
- `CLASS_NOT_INCLUDED`: Class not included in user's package
- `SESSION_FULL`: Session is at capacity
- `ALREADY_BOOKED`: User already booked this session

## ðŸ”§ Additional Improvements

### Database Enhancements
- **Test Card Initialization**: Automatically creates test cards during seeding
- **Better Validation**: Enhanced foreign key relationships
- **Improved Cleanup**: Proper handling of pending subscriptions

### API Improvements
- **Immediate Responses**: No more hanging requests
- **Better Error Codes**: Specific error codes for different scenarios
- **Enhanced Logging**: Better error logging for debugging

### Frontend Sync
- **Real-time Updates**: Proper query invalidation after state changes
- **Consistent State**: Better synchronization between components
- **User Feedback**: Clear messages for all user actions

## ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions

### Test the Payment System
1. Create a subscription on the Packages page
2. Use test card: `4111111111111111` (Valid Visa)
3. Payment should process immediately
4. Subscription should become active

### Test Class Booking
1. After successful subscription, go to Classes page
2. Select any class included in your package
3. Booking should work without Error 500
4. Real-time updates should show reduced capacity

### Test Error Scenarios
1. Try booking without subscription â†’ Clear error message
2. Try booking class not in package â†’ Upgrade suggestion
3. Try payment with `4000000000000002` â†’ Decline simulation
